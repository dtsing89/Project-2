# Project-2
#### Team names: Lina Larson, Brett Scheneider, David Tsing

## comments or assumptions
###### 1) Comments from project 1 apply here as well since we are building off it. 
###### 2) The Zoo announcer doesn't need to announce everything, and doesn't need to announce when they are done for the night.  
###### 3) For Zooclock, the class only needs to keep track of the time and hold the time (not implement any other actions) 
###### 4) Delegation works very similar to inheritance. 

## Issues
###### 1) Through eclipse we had to give each class its own file, making it messy and difficult at times to keep track of. 
###### 2) We had issues updating two observeables at the same time, but in the end we only needed to add an "if" statement. 


## Instructions to run code
###### 1) Download the code or copy the workspace using " git clone https://github.com/dtsing89/Project-2.git" in your comand line/ terminal. 
###### 2) Open Zoo.java and click run.
###### 3) Where it askes for days put in desired days.
###### 4) See that we finished the project with minimal tears.
